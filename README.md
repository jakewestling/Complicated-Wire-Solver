#Complicated Wires Solver - Keep Talking & Nobody Explodes Game

Description:
The hardest module of the fun game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" is the Complicated Wires Module.
Trying to solve this multi-ring Venn diagram quickly was proving challenging.
This program simplifies and hastens the process by asking yes or no questions about the 
bomb and module. A simple CUT THE WIRE or DO NOT CUT is then displayed for each wire. 

What I Learned:
java.util.Scanner and input.next were used to gather user inputs.
System.out.println was used to prompt user for inputs and display answers.
While loops were used to test all individual wires.
If statements were used to check user inputs for answers.
